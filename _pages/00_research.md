I am interested in gaining insights from people and technology and finding solutions to design better lives. How to communicate with complex structural systems and how to easily deliver values are the major areas of my research.

## Data and AI 

The most important thing as technology advances is how to deliver it as value.
Machine learning and deep learning have the potential to help us solve many problems in the future. Data is the fuel that allows this to happen.
Data is everywhere. User log data, in particular, is the user's footprint of products and services. Based on this, we can work on data-driven or AI-assisted decision-making.
As a result, I am interested in human-centered AI products and experiences, and I am eager to learn more about this field.

## XR and Spatial UX

I believe that XR and Metaverse will become widely used in the next generation (much as mobile phones in this era), so I am quite interested in this field.

Virtual and spatial experiences, such as virtually improved physical reality and virtually persistent space, are of interest to me.
Hoping for a more accessible future, I anticipate that those who experience difficulties in the actual world may find a remedy in the virtual world.
Let's take the case of a virtual user interface that functions just like the real one. Compared to complex interactions with real-space products, this interface would be significantly simpler for elderly folks to learn and utilize.

Because I believe that entertaining and attractive services outperform all others, I am also fascinated by gamification of daily life and games in daily life.
