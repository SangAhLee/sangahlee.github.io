Hi! I have over 8 years of UX research and design expertise, as well as 4 years of SW engineering experience, including an internship.

## Experiences

I have experience with user-centered design techniques. I appreciate overcoming obstacles and finding effective, creative solutions. In addition to designing UX for mobile app services, I have also worked on TV software, media-concept UX for universal design, and other projects.

Additionally, I am well-versed in the software and technologies used by mobile and web devices. 
I am cooperative and tenacious. I view collaboration with others as one of my skills.
You can learn more about my professional background at [My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sangah-lee/) if you're interested.


## Strengths

- I've collaborated with SW/HW developers, project managers, and visual/interaction designers. Working with other people is one of my strengths.
- My experience spans a variety of fields, including design research and actual UI design.
- I have good skills to convey concepts through wireframes, Information Architecture, and flows.
- I can design complex structures more effectively since I have a solid understanding of digital technology and development.


## Interests

- I enjoy all forms of media (Video, Music and Game).

- I study English (intermediate) and Chinese (beginer).
Each country's communication methods and systems are unique. Language has an impact on how people think, which is fascinating.

- I like discovering new technologies and learn how to use them.
Before designing and implementing, I believe that understanding must always come first.
